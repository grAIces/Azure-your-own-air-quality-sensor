# Azure your own air quality sensor 

Hi everyone! 

For those who skip intros:

In this tutorial you will learn how to:
- build an air quality measurement device from scratch,
- manage the sensor data in the cloud,
- predict air pollution levels.

First things first - we will start with a bit of IoT and Machine Learning - all of this connected to Azure Cloud. We want to show you how to build a simple air quality sensor that you can place in your house, garden or office building. 

Who can use this tutorial? Simply everyone. Regardless of your programming skills, you can either simply copy the code to your editor, or dig in it a bit, changing what you might find most suitable.
